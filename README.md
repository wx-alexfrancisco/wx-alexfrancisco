## 👋 Hey there, I’m Alex Francisco

- 👀 I’m endlessly curious about digital design, systems thinking, learning tools, and how to make complex things beautifully simple.
- 🌱 Currently learning: sustainable design, 3D printing (a fancy way to make more stuff I don’t have space for), and sharpening my coding toolkit.
- 💞️ Open to collaborating on anything that blends design, learning, and a dash of human magic — bonus points if it makes people go “oh, that’s clever!”
- 📫 Find me here on GitHub or track me down on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/) *(add your link — or carrier pigeon coordinates, your call)*.
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I used to be a toolmaker for over a decade — now I design digital tools instead of metal ones, but I still believe everything’s better with a good blueprint.
